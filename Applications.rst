Applications of Deep Learning
*****************************

**Advertising**

Data can be collected for users based on their search history, suggesting what users may be interested in. Deep Learning can then be used to infer what ads a person may be more likely to click on, and show them only those ads. 

**Natural Language Processing**

Deep Learning algorithms can be used to translate from speech to text by being trained to recognize the english language. This is used in many of today's voice recognition softwares.

**Computer Vision**

Deep Learning algorithms can be trained to recognize what objects are in images. This is applicable to industries such as self-driving vehicles, allowing cars to "see" and "understand" their surroundings.
