What is a neural network?
-------------------------
Neural networks are computing systems that are modeled after the brains of living animals. These systems "learn" from data that is provided to them. By providing neural networks with enough data to learn from, they can then make accurate predictions based on what they have learned.

-------------------------
The Basics
-------------------------
A neural network consists of an X input and a Y output. The input can be as small or large as desired, and is used to reach the final output Y.
