What is a neural network?
-------------------------
Neural networks are computing systems that are modeled after the brains of living animals. They consist of neurons that are all connected to create a network. These systems "learn" from data that is provided to them. By providing neural networks with enough data, they are capable of making accurate predictions based on what they have learned.

-------------------------
The Basics
-------------------------
The function of neural networks is fairly straightforward and basic. An input is provided to the network, and after some calulcations are made, an output is returned. For example, if we wanted to have a program that could determine if there is a dog in a picture then the input to the neural network would be a picture, and the output would be true or false based on whether the network thinks the picture contains a dog or not.

In order for neural networks to be able to make these predictions, they must be given data to train. Training a neural network involves providing a large amount of input data and corresponding output data. Neural networks are able to make calculations to infer relationships between the inputs and outputs, and create a system for accurately being able to predict an outcome when only given an input.
